\'d2Yes, but how will we ever keep track of such a large project?\'d3 This proposal provides an answer to such questions. Firstly, it discusses the problem of information access at CERN.  Then, it introduces the idea of linked information systems, and compares them with less flexible ways of finding information.\par It then summarises my short experience with non-linear text systems known as \'d2hypertext\'d3,  describes what CERN needs from such a system, and what industry may provide. Finally, it suggests steps we should take to involve ourselves with hypertext now, so that individually and collectively we may understand what we are creating.\par \pard\plain \s254\li580\sa240\keep\keepn\pagebb \b\f16\fs28 Losing Information at CERN\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 CERN is a wonderful organisation. It involves several thousand people, many of them very creative, all working toward common goals. Although they are nominally organised into a hierarchical management structure,this does not constrain the way people will communicate, and share information, equipment and software across groups. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 The actual observed working structure of the organisation is a multiply connected \'d2web\'d3 whose interconnections evolve with time. In this environment, a new person arriving, or someone taking on a new task, is normally given a few hints as to who would be useful people to talk to. Information about what facilities exist and how to find out about them travels in the corridor gossip and occasional newsletters, and the details about what is required to be done spread in a similar way. All things considered, the result is remarkably successful, despite occasional misunderstandings and duplicated effort.\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 A problem, however, is the high turnover of people. When two years is a typical length of stay, information is constantly being lost. The introduction of the new people demands a fair amount of their time and that of others before they have any idea of what goes on. The technical details of past projects are sometimes lost forever, or only recovered after a detective investigation in an emergency. Often, the information has been recorded, it just cannot be found. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 If a CERN experiment were a static once-only development, all the information could be written in a big book. As it is, CERN is constantly changing as new ideas are produced, as new technology becomes available, and in order to get around unforeseen technical problems. When a change is necessary, it normally affects only a small part of the organisation. A local reason arises for changing a part of the experiment or detector. At this point, one has to dig around to find out what other parts and people will be affected. Keeping a book up to date becomes impractical, and the structure of the book needs to be constantly revised.\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 The sort of information we are discussing answers, for example, questions like\par \pard\plain \s16\fi-560\li3100\sa80\keep\tx3100\tx5040 \f16  \'a5\tab Where is this module used?\par  \'a5\tab Who wrote this code?

CERN meets now some problems which the rest of the world will have to face soon. In 10 years, there may be many commercial solutions to the problems above, while today we need something to allow us to continue{\fs18\up6 \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s246\qj\li2400\sa240 \f16\fs18 {\up6 \chftn }The same has been true, for example, of electronic mail gateways, document preparation, and heterogeneous distributed programming systems. }}.\par \pard\plain \s254\li580\sa240\keep\keepn\pagebb \b\f16\fs28 Linked information systems\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16  In providing a system for manipulating this sort of information, the hope would be to allow a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve with the organisation and the projects it describes. For this to be possible,\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 {\b the method of storage must not place its own restraints on the information.}\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 This is why a "web" of notes with links (like references) between them is far more useful than a fixed hierarchical system. When describing a complex system, many people resort to diagrams with circles and arrows.

The system we need is like a diagram of circles and arrows, where circles and arrows can stand for anything. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 We can call the circles nodes, and the arrows links.

The CERNDOC documentation system is an example, as is the Unix file system, and the VMS/HELP system. A tree has the practical advantage of giving every node a unique name. However, it does not allow the system to model the real world. For example, in a hierarchical HELP system such as VMS/HELP, one often gets to a leaf on a tree such as\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 {\f22 HELP COMPILER SOURCE_FORMAT PRAGMAS DEFAULTS\par }\pard \qj\li2400\sa240 only to find a reference to another leaf\: "Please see\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 {\f22 HELP COMPILER COMMAND OPTIONS DEFAULTS PRAGMAS"\par }\pard \qj\li2400\sa240 and it is necessary to leave the system and re-enter it. What was needed was a link from one node to another, because in this case {\i the information was not naturally organised into a tree.}\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 Another example of a tree-structured system is the uucp News system (try 'rn' under Unix). This is a hierarchical system of discussions ("newsgroups") each containing articles contributed by many people. It is a very useful method of pooling expertise, but suffers from the inflexibility of a tree. Typically, a discussion under one newsgroup will develop into a different topic, at which point it ought to be in a different part of the tree.

The usual problem with keywords, however, is that two people never chose the same keywords. The keywords then become useful only to people who already know the application well.\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 Practical keyword systems (such as that of VAX/NOTES for example) require keywords to be registered. This is already a step in the right direction. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 A linked system takes this to the next logical step. Keywords can be nodes which stand for a concept. A keyword node is then no different from any other node. One can link documents, etc., to keywords. One can then find keywords by finding any node to which they are related. In this way, documents on similar topics are indirectly linked, through their key concepts. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 A keyword search then becomes a search starting from a small number of named nodes, and finding nodes which are close to all of them.\par \pard \qc\li2400\sa240\brdrt\brdrs \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 It was for these reasons that I first made a small linked information system, not realising that a term had already been coined for the idea\: \'d2hypertext\'d3.\par \pard\plain \s254\li580\sa240\keep\keepn\pagebb \b\f16\fs28 A solution\: Hypertext\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Personal Experience with Hypertext\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 In 1980, I wrote a program for keeping track of software with which I was involved in the PS control system. Called {\i Enquire}, it allowed one to store snippets of information, and to link related pieces together in any way. To find information, one progressed via the links from one sheet to another, rather like in the old computer game "adventure". I used this for my personal record of people and modules. It was similar to the application {\i Hypercard} produced more recently by Apple for the Macintosh. A difference was that {\i Enquire}, although lacking the fancy graphics, ran on a multiuser system, and allowed many people to access the same data.\par \pard\plain \s21\ri100\sa240\keep\box\brdrs \tx960\tx1920\tx2880\tx3840\tx4800\tx5760\tx6720\tx7680\tx8640 \f22\fs20 {\b Documentation of the RPC project                       (concept)\line }\line \line    Most of the documentation is available on VMS, with the two\line    principle manuals being stored in the CERNDOC system.\line \line     1) includes\: The VAX/NOTES conference VXCERN\:\:RPC                       \line     2) includes\: Test and Example suite                                     \line     3) includes\: RPC BUG LISTS                                              \line     4) includes\: RPC System\: Implementation Guide                           \line        Information for maintenance, porting, etc.\line     5) includes\: Suggested Development Strategy for RPC Applications  \line     6) includes\: "Notes on RPC", Draft 1, 20 feb 86                         \line     7) includes\: "Notes on Proposed RPC Development" 18 Feb 86              \line     8) includes\: RPC User Manual                                            \line        How to build and run a distributed system.                           \line     9) includes\: Draft Specifications and Implementation Notes              \line    10) includes\: The RPC HELP facility                                      \line    11) describes\: THE REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL PROJECT in DD/OC                \line                                                                             \line                                                                             \line                                                                             \line                                                                             \line                                                                            \line  {\f0 Help  Display  Select  Back  Quit Mark  Goto_mark  Link  Add  Edit}\line \par \pard\plain \s11\qj\fi-960\li960\sa240\tx960\tx1920\tx2880\tx3840\tx4800\tx5760\tx6720\tx7680 \i\f16\fs20 Fig 2.\tab A screen in an  Enquire scheme.\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 This example is basically a list, so the list of links is more important than the text on the node itself. Note that each link has a type ("includes" for example) and may also have comment associated with it. (The bottom line is a menu bar.)\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 Soon after my re-arrival at CERN in the DD division, I found that the environment was similar to that in PS, and I missed {\i Enquire}. I therefore produced a version for the VMS, and have used it to keep track of projects, people, groups, experiments, software modules and hardware devices with which I have worked. I have found it personally very useful. I have made no effort to make it suitable for general consumption, but have found that a few people have successfully used it to browse through the projects and find out all sorts of things of their own accord.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Hot spots\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16  Meanwhile, several programs have been made exploring these ideas, both commercially and academically.  Most of them use "hot spots" in documents, like icons, or highlighted phrases, as sensitive areas. touching a hot spot with a mouse brings up the relevant information, or expands the text on the screen to include it. Imagine, then, the references in this document, all being associated with the network address of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the mouse.\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 "Hypertext" is a term coined in the 1950s by Ted Nelson [...], which has become popular for these systems, although it is used to embrace two different ideas. One idea (which is relevant to this problem) is the concept\:\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240\box\brdrs \'d2Hypertext\'d3\:   Human-readable information linked together in an unconstrained way.\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 The other idea, which is independent and largely a question of technology and time, is of multimedia documents which include graphics, speech and video. I will not discuss this latter aspect further here, although I will use the word "Hypermedia" to indicate that one is not bound to text. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 It has been difficult to assess the effect of a large hypermedia system on an organisation, often because these systems never had seriously large-scale use. For this reason, we require large amounts of existing information should be accessible using any new information management system.\par \pard\plain \s254\li580\sa240\keep\keepn\pagebb \b\f16\fs28 CERN Requirements\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 To be a practical system in the CERN environment, there are a number of clear practical requirements.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Remote access across networks.\par \pard\plain \s16\fi-560\li3100\sa80\keep\tx3100\tx5040 \f16 \tab CERN is distributed, and access from remote machines is essential.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Heterogeneity\par \pard\plain \s16\fi-560\li3100\sa80\keep\tx3100\tx5040 \f16 \tab Access is required to the same data from different types of system (VM/CMS, Macintosh, VAX/VMS, Unix)\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Non-Centralisation\par \pard\plain \s16\fi-560\li3100\sa80\keep\tx3100\tx5040 \f16 \tab Information systems start small and grow. They also start isolated and then merge. A new system must allow existing systems to be linked together without requiring any central control or coordination.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Access to existing data\par \pard\plain \s16\fi-560\li3100\sa80\keep\tx3100\tx5040 \f16 \tab If we provide access to existing databases as though they were in hypertext form, the system will get off the ground quicker.

Addition of graphics would be an optional extra with very much less penetration for the moment. \par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Data analysis\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 An intriguing possibility, given a large hypertext database with typed links, is that it allows some degree of automatic analysis. It is possible to search, for example, for anomalies such as undocumented software or divisions which contain no people. It is possible to generate lists of people or devices for other purposes, such as mailing lists of people to be informed of changes. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 It is also possible to look at the topology of an organisation or a project, and draw conclusions about how it should be managed, and how it could evolve. This is particularly useful when the database becomes very large, and groups of projects, for example, so interwoven as to make it difficult to see the wood for the trees. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 In a complex place like CERN, it's not always obvious how to divide people into groups. Imagine making a large three-dimensional model, with people represented by little spheres, and strings between people who have something in common at work.\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 Now imagine picking up the structure and shaking it, until you make some sense of the tangle\: perhaps, you see tightly knit groups in some places, and in some places weak areas of communication spanned by only a few people. Perhaps a linked information system will allow us to see the real structure of the organisation in which we work.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Live links\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 The data to which a link (or a hot spot) refers may be very static, or it may be temporary.  In many cases at CERN information about the state of systems is changing all the time. Hypertext allows documents to be linked into "live" data so that every time the link is followed, the information is retrieved. If one sacrifices portability, it is possible so make following a link fire up a special application, so that diagnostic programs, for example, could be linked directly into the maintenance guide.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Non requirements\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 Discussions on Hypertext have sometimes tackled the problem of copyright enforcement and data security. These are of secondary importance at CERN, where information exchange is still more important than secrecy. Authorisation and accounting systems for hypertext could conceivably be designed which are very sophisticated, but they are not proposed here.\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240  In cases where reference must be made to data which is in fact protected, existing file protection systems should be sufficient.\par \pard\plain \s254\li580\sa240\keep\keepn\pagebb \b\f16\fs28 Specific Applications\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 The following are three examples of specific places in which the proposed system would be immediately useful. There are many others. \par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Development Project Documentation.\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 The Remote procedure Call project has a skeleton description using {\i Enquire}. Although limited, it is very useful for recording who did what, where they are, what documents exist, etc. Also, one can keep track of users, and can easily append any extra little bits of information which come to hand and have nowhere else to be put. Cross-links to other projects, and to databases which contain information on people and documents would be very useful, and save duplication of information.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Document retrieval.\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 The CERNDOC system provides the mechanics of storing and printing documents. A linked system would allow one to browse through concepts, documents, systems and authors, also allowing references between documents to be stored. (Once a document had been found, the existing machinery could be invoked to print it or display it).\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 The "Personal Skills Inventory".\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 Personal skills and experience are just the sort of thing which need hypertext flexibility.

There have been two conferences, Hypertext\~'87 and '88, and in Washington DC, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NST) hosted a workshop on standardisation in hypertext, a followup of which will occur during  1990.\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 The {\i Communications of the ACM} special issue on Hypertext contains many references to hypertext papers.  A bibliography on hypertext is given in [NIST90], and a uucp newsgroup {\f22 alt.hypertext} exists.  I do not, therefore, give a list here.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Browsing techniques\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 Much of the academic research is into the human interface side of browsing through a complex information space.  Problems addressed are those of making navigation easy, and avoiding a feeling of being "lost in hyperspace". Whilst the results of the research are interesting, many users at CERN will be accessing the system using primitive terminals, and so advanced window styles are not so important for us now.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Interconnection or publication?\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 Most systems available today use a single database. This is accessed by many users by using a distributed file system. There are few products which take Ted Nelson's idea of a wide "docuverse" literally by allowing links between nodes in different databases. In order to do this, some standardisation would be necessary. However, at the standardisation workshop, the emphasis was on standardisation of the format for exchangeable media, nor for networking. This is prompted by the strong push toward publishing of hypermedia information, for example on optical disk.   There seems to be a general consensus about the abstract data model which a hypertext system should use.\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 Many systems have been put together with little or no regard for portability, unfortunately. Some others, although published, are proprietary software which is not for external release. However, there are several interesting projects and more are appearing all the time. Digital's "Compound Document Architecture" (CDA) , for example, is a data model which may be extendible into a hypermedia model, and there are rumours that this is a way Digital would like to go.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 Incentives and CALS\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 The US Department of Defence has given a big incentive to hypermedia research by, in effect,  specifying hypermedia documentation for future procurement.  This means that all manuals for parts for defence equipment must be provided in hypermedia form. The acronym CALS stands for \'d2Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistic Support).\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 There is also much support from the publishing industry,  and from librarians whose job it is to organise information.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 What will the system look like?\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 Let us see what components a hypertext system at CERN must have.\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 The only way in which sufficient flexibility can be incorporated is to separate the information storage software from the information display software, with a well defined interface between them. Given the requirement for network access, it is natural to let this clean interface coincide with the physical division between the user and the remote database machine{\fs18\up6 \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 {\up6 \chftn } A client/server split at this level also makes multi-access more easy, in that a single server process can service many clients, avoiding the problems

After that, the development of various forms of display program and of database server can proceed in parallel. This will have been done well if many different information sources, past, present and future, can be mapped onto the definition, and if many different human interface programs can be written over the years to take advantage of new technology and standards.\par \pard\plain \s254\li580\sa240\keep\keepn\pagebb \b\f16\fs28 Accessing Existing Data\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 {\b The system must achieve a critical usefulness early on. }Existing hypertext systems have had to justify themselves solely on new data. If, however, there was an existing base of data of personnel, for example, to which new data could be linked, the value of each new piece of data would be greater. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 What is required is a gateway program which will map an existing structure onto the hypertext model, and allow limited (perhaps read-only) access to it. This takes the form of a hypertext server written to provide existing information in a form matching the standard interface.

News}\tab This is a Unix electronic conferencing system. A server for uucp news could makes links between notes on the same subject, as well as showing the structure of the conferences.\par {\b VAX/Notes}\tab This is Digital's electronic conferencing system. It has a fairly wide following in FermiLab, but much less in CERN. The topology of a conference is quite restricting.\par {\b CERNDOC}\tab This is a document registration and distribution system running on CERN's VM machine. As well as documents, categories and projects, keywords and authors lend themselves to representation as hypertext nodes.\par {\b File systems}\tab This would allow any file to be linked to from other hypertext documents.\par T{\b he Telephone Book}\tab Even this could even be viewed as hypertext, with links between people and sections, sections and groups, people and floors of buildings, etc.\par {\b The unix manual}\tab This is a large body of computer-readable text, currently organised in a flat way, but which also contains link information in a standard format ("See also..").\par {\b Databases}\tab A generic tool could perhaps be made to allow any database which uses a commercial DBMS to be displayed as a hypertext view.\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 In some cases, writing these servers would mean unscrambling or obtaining details of the existing protocols and/or file formats. It may not be practical to provide the full functionality of the original system through hypertext. In general, it will be more important to allow read access to the general public\: it may be that there is a limited number of people who are providing the information, and that they are content to use the existing facilities. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 It is sometimes possible to enhance an existing storage system by coding hypertext information in, if one knows that a server will be generating a hypertext representation. In 'news' articles, for example, one could use (in the text) a standard format for a reference to another article. This would be picked out by the hypertext gateway and used to generate a link to that note. This sort of enhancement will allow greater integration between old and new systems. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 There will always be a large number of information management systems - we get a lot of added usefulness from being able to cross-link them. However, we will lose out if we try to constrain them, as we will exclude systems and hamper the evolution of hypertext in general.\par \pard\plain \s254\li580\sa240\keep\keepn\pagebb \b\f16\fs28 Conclusion\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 We should work toward  a universal linked information system, in which generality and portability are more important than fancy graphics techniques and complex extra facilities. \par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 The aim would be to allow a place to be found for any information or reference which one felt was important, and a way of finding it afterwards. The result should be sufficiently attractive to use that it the information contained would grow past a critical threshold, so that the usefulness the scheme would in turn encourage its increased use.\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240  The passing of this threshold accelerated by allowing large existing databases to be linked together and with new ones.\par \pard\plain \s253\qj\li1200\sa240\keep\keepn \b\f16 A Practical Project\par \pard\plain \qj\li2400\sa240 \f16 Here I suggest the practical steps to go to in order to find a real solution at CERN.

An important part of this, discussed below, is the integration of a hypertext system with existing data, so as to provide a universal system, and to achieve critical usefulness at an early stage. \par (... and yes, this would provide an excellent project with which to try our new object oriented programming techniques!)\par \par TBL March 1989, May 1990\par \pard \qj\li2400\sa240 \par \pard\plain \s254\li580\sa240\keep\keepn\pagebb \b\f16\fs28 References\par \pard\plain \s6\qj\fi-1340\li1920\sa180\tx2540\tx2640 \f16\fs20 [NEL67]\tab Nelson, T.H.
